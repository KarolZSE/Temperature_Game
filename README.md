Hi! The goal of this game is to guess the correct temperature for a city on the map. 
The temperature is sourced from Open-Meteo in real-time, so it should be pretty accurate. 
Have fun! Please avoid spamming the refresh button, as the API operators have to pay for that.

I know the code is messy its my first project I hope you like it.

Special thanks to:
